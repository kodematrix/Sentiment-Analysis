1- Most of the words are positive, which proofs that it is a very uplifting scripture in comparison with other murderous mystery books that would have many negative words.

2- The use of word "lord" is constantly declining from which I am hypothesizing that maybe early in the book Krishna is addressed as "Lord or Lord Krishna" but towards the end it would have been just "Krishna"
